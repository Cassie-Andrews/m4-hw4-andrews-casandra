            <h3>Influences</h3>
            <p>
                Klint was inspired by nature, botany, mathematics, and spirituality. She attended the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in the last 1800s. At this time, her public-facing work focused on landscapes and portrait paintings while in Klint's personal time, she was creating the artwork for which she is known today. It wasn't until after her death that the work she's regarded for today was seen by the public.

            <h3>Spiritism</h3>
            <p>
                The passing of Klint's sister led her to delve into the realm of spiritism. Spiritism was a timely movement that incorporated a variety of beliefs regarding the afterlife into one doctrine. It includes ideas based on science, philosophy, Christianity, the Theosophical Movement, and more. Spiritism was hugely influential in Klint's personal life and art. Klint and her group of fellow artists called "The Five" regularly carried out s√©ances and shared their beliefs on spiritism, religion, and philosophy.

                Through these practices, Hilma af Klint created abstract paintings and automatic drawings, amalgamating her beliefs and artistic abilities into a cohesive visual language made up of geometric forms, fields of color, and intuitive mark-making all meant to express experiences beyond human comprehension.
